## Project Title
NFT Collectibles for Solving Complex Challenges

## Project Description
The **ChallengeNFT** project is a blockchain-based platform that uses NFTs to represent and reward individuals or teams for solving complex challenges. Each challenge is minted as a unique NFT with a description and metadata. Ownership of the NFT signifies responsibility for the challenge, and completion is marked transparently on the blockchain.

This project gamifies problem-solving by allowing participants to showcase their achievements through collectible NFTs, fostering an environment of innovation and recognition.
